Domain Questionnaire:

1. List 10 available domains (use http://iwantmyname.com) you think would be appropriate for your site:
technosnake.co
etchasnake.com
snakeremix.com
paintsnake.com
paintthedot.com
getthedot.co
colorsnake.co
rightangles.co
snakecharmer.co

2. What type or genre of domain is this? (Ex. Game, Toy, Greeting Card Generator, Creative Tool, Political Pamphlet, Archive)
Game

3. Write a small story (one paragraph or so) that details a user's experience of discovering your domain, visiting it within a particular context (like mobile, desktop, while hungry, at a funeral, etc.), experiencing what it has to offer, and subsequently leaving.
Users will discover my domain and immediately be thrown into a seemingly familiar game of 'Snake.'
Using interactions with certain keys, the color and shape/pattern of the snake will begin to change.
The snake's path will be digitally painted onto the site's default black background.
Upon completion/failure of the game, the user can then choose to save the 'background' that they have  created as an image file.
They also have the option to restart the game with either the existing 'canvas' or a new, blank black one.
Or they can choose to do none of the above and leave the website.

4. Would somebody return to your domain after visiting it for the first time - in how long do you think - and why?
I feel that they would, to either create different visuals or to share with friends, or to simply attempt to get better at the game and top their best playthrough.

5. List some 'stuff' that your site 'does'. (Be detailed)
Plays snake-like game
Creates an image
Saves the image
